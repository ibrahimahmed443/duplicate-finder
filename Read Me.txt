Duplicate File Finder is a Linux/Unix utility than scans your hard drive for finding duplicates of a given file.

To run the program, you need to supply two inputs.

(1) Base Directory
This is the starting directory for scanning. Base directory will be completely scanned (including directories inside the Base directory) to find duplicates

(2) File Name
This is the file name you want to find duplicates of.


Sample Run:
suppose you have a directory named, /home/user. Inside this directory, you want to scan duplicates of a file /home/file.txt (Note that "File Name" may not be necessarily inside of "Base Directory"), you would run the program as follows...

./duplicatefilefinder.exe /home/user /home/file.txt

assumming that duplicatefilefinder.exe is in your path.
